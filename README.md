# Timetable-Generator

Parses the source from a Student Allocator page and generates a basic .ics calendar with all classes, labs, and tutorials.
The generated file can be imported into calendar applications such as Google Calendar.

**Note**: Trimester dates are currently hardcoded and therefore it is assumed that all classes on the timetable run for the entire trimester. Mid-trimester breaks are currently not implemented (to be added in the future).

This is a Javascript implementation (client side).
